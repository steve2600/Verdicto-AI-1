## 💡 If Judges Ask...

**Q: "How is this different from ChatGPT?"**  
A: "ChatGPT is general-purpose. We're specialized for Indian legal context with InLegalBERT. We have multilingual support, document generation, and what-if simulation specifically for legal strategy. Plus, we provide explainable AI with bias detection."

**Q: "Can this scale?"**  
A: "Absolutely. We use FastAPI (async), Docker containers, and modular architecture. We can add more languages, document types, or ML models easily. Infrastructure is cloud-ready."

**Q: "What about accuracy?"**  
A: "We use InLegalBERT fine-tuned on Indian legal cases, cross-encoder reranking for precision, and provide confidence scores with every prediction. We also have bias detection to ensure fairness."

**Q: "How do you handle privacy?"**  
A: "We have PII redaction capability (can demonstrate if needed). All processing can be done on-premise. We don't store user data unnecessarily. Audit trails for compliance."
